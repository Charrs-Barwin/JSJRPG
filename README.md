Turn based JRPG combat demo:

Choose a party of two characters from a pool of five playable characters, and fight through a mini gauntlet of battles ending in a boss battle.

Project is very scalable. My first addition would be a timer that determines Unit turns so that combat can be real time while still menu driven. And once the base works, adding Playable characters, abilities, enemies and encounters would be easy.


Functionality & MVPs

In JSJRPG, users will be able to:

- Choose two characters to form a team, from up to five choosable characters
- Use quick button based commands in battle. Each character will have unique abilities
- fight against multiple enemy types, leading to a boss battle at the end

In addition, this project will include:
- Adjustable settings before starting a game
- An inventory system with consumable items
- Learnable abilities for each playable character
- Ability to use a turn to toggle which of your characters is in front.
- unique defensive abilities for each character so that each has a strategic role on the front lines
- possibility to add features such as stat alotment for level ups, and findable/wearable equipment


There wouldn't be any camera work or collisions involved, but animating attacks and damage displays could be tricky. I'm kind of lost as to what libraries I'll be using, or how I even setup the framework to start. I know I'll need to tween objects, and that google search brought me to something called creatjs.

Timeline:
Timeline is tbd at this time, until I start some actual work on the project.
The most significant factor would be when I get to a point where some basic action is working, and I can start adding objects and behavior to the game. Then I'll be in a much better position to determine a timeline.
