Turn based JRPG combat demo:

Choose a party of two characters from a pool of playable characters, and fight through a mini gauntlet of battles ending in a boss battle.
program your parites ai and watch battles unfold based on your instructions.
Project is very scalable. Visuals have yet to be implemented, 
but I'm currently in the process of integrating creatjs for visuals and animation.
